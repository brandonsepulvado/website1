abstract = "The use of historical data with social network analysis is a topic that has received much interest of late, yet there exists little practical introduction to the research process for this methodology. While historical researchers frequently have an introduction to archival research methods and social network analysts often encounter the detailed data structure required for this type of research, few individuals from either background have a well-rounded knowledge of the entire set of considerations necessary for historical network analysis. This case study discusses how to decide if network analysis is proper for a particular historical research question, how to formulate a research and data collection strategy, and how to create analyzable data. Two principle approaches to historical analysis are discussed in relation to these issues. In order to illustrate these approaches and the relevant considerations when conducting such research, two empirical case studies are used: the emergence of sociology and neurology in France."
