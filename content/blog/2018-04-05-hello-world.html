<p>Welcome to my new website and blog! I am in the process of migrating most of the content from my previous website; this site is built using the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a> R package along with the <a href="https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme">Cocoa Hugo theme</a>.</p>
<p>The blog content will vary widely between posts related to research in progress, those that I write because I enjoy the substantive content, and those I write in order to learn a new tool or package. I might even post functions I write about which I am particularly excited.</p>
<p>Any feedback is very much welcome. Whether you have questions about my code or want to provide suggestions on how to improve my code, please get in touch.</p>
