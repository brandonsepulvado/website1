 Welcome to my new website and blog! I am in the process of migrating most of the content from my previous website; this site is built using the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package along with the [Cocoa Hugo theme](https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme).
 
 The blog content will vary widely between posts related to research in progress, those that I write because I enjoy the substantive content, and those I write in order to learn a new tool or package. 
 
 Any feedback is very much welcome. Whether you have questions about my code or want to provide suggestions on how to improve my code, please get in touch.
