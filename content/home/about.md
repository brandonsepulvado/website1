# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame, where I am also affiliated with the Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications (iCeNSA). My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, a Fulbright fellowship, a Chateaubriand fellowship, the Nanovic Institute for European Studies, the Countway Library of Medicine, and several other private organizations. During the 2017-2018 academic year, I am additionally associated with the Groupe d'Étude des Méthodes de l'Analyse Sociologique de la Sorbonne (GEMASS) in Paris, France.
