I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame, where I am also affiliated with the Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications (iCeNSA). I specialize in computational social science. My research has been supported by the U.S. government (through the National Science Foundation and a Fulbright fellowship), the French government (through a Chateaubriand fellowship), the Nanovic Institute for European Studies, the Countway Library of Medicine, and several other private organizations. During the 2017-2018 academic year, I am additionally associated with the Groupe d'Étude des Méthodes de l'Analyse Sociologique de la Sorbonne (GEMASS) in Paris, France.
