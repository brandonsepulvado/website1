Currently a data scientist at NORC at the University of Chicago, I use machine learning and statistics to derive actionable insights from data. I have considerable experience designing and leading research as well as developing tools and methods that improve organizations' decision-making capactities. My areas of speciality with data science are natural language processing and network analysis, and I regularly program in Python, R, and SQL and use the scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow frameworks for machine/deep learning. 

My work has been funded by the National Science Foundation, a Fulbright fellowship, the Government of France, and the Countway Library of Medicine (Harvard/Boston Medical Library), and I regularly review for a variety of data science and social science outlets: e.g., _Widening NLP (WiNLP)_, _American Sociological Review_, _American Journal of Sociology_, _PLOS One_, _Social Science Computer Review_, _American Journal of Sociology_, _Sociological Theory_, _Acta Sociologica_, _Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion_, and _Social Science Journal_. I serve currently as Secretary of the Washington Statistical Society.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame, where I was also affiliated with the Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications (iCeNSA; now it is called the Center for Network and Data Science) and am a previous affiliate of the Groupe d'Étude des Méthodes de l'Analyse Sociologique de la Sorbonne (GEMASS) in Paris, France.
