Currently a data scientist at NORC at the University of Chicago, I use machine learning and statistics to derive actionable insights from data. I have considerable experience designing and leading research as well as developing tools and methods that improve organizations' decision-making capactities. My areas of speciality with data science are natural language processing and network analysis, and I regularly program in Python, R, and SQL and use the scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow frameworks for machine/deep learning. My work has been funded by the National Science Foundation, a Fulbright fellowship, the Government of France, and the Countway Library of Medicine (Harvard/Boston Medical Library).

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame, where I was also affiliated with the Interdisciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications (iCeNSA; now it is called the Center for Network and Data Science) and am a previous affiliate of the Groupe d'Étude des Méthodes de l'Analyse Sociologique de la Sorbonne (GEMASS) in Paris, France.
