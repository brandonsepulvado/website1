      <description>In my first post, I am going to begin what will most likely be a three-part series on the evolution of bioethics publications over the last several decades. This post is mostly about getting the data in order and exploring what the amazing tidytext package has to offer.
Bioethics has emerged over the last several decades from several branches of ethics (e.g., medical and religious) to form a domain with its own set of conceptual and institutional structures.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new website and blog! I am in the process of migrating most of the content from my previous website; this site is built using the blogdown R package along with the Cocoa Hugo theme.
The blog content will vary widely between posts related to research in progress, those that I write because I enjoy the substantive content, and those I write in order to learn a new tool or package.</description>
